Welcome to Better Code, Littler Classes!

Today we'll refactor some code!  For each refactoring, first the speaker will demonstrate it (in Java), and then you'll do it.  But first, you'll need to do some setup.

Here are three options.  More details follow below.

OPTION 1: If you're comfortable in Java, and you have a fairly new computer (~2 years or newer) with at least 6gb free disk space, you can run the provided VM, which has the project already set up in IntelliJ for you.  (Don't worry if you don't know IntelliJ's shortcuts; it's OK, because we're doing things by hand today.)

OPTION 2: If you'd rather work with Java in your own familiar setup, go to the Code/flatwiki-example/java directory.  Import it into the IDE of your choice.  (Eclipse users have had good luck importing it as an ant project; IntelliJ users may wish to use the pom.xml.)  Because environments differ, we may not be able to help if you're having trouble.

OPTION 3: If you're not comfortable with Java, we've translated the example into Ruby and C# as well.  The ruby and csharp directories under Code/flatwiki-example/ contain the translations.  Note that you'll see us doing the work in Java during the talk.

DETAILS:

Option 1 (VM):

1. Copy the BetterCodeVM.ova file onto your hard drive.
2. Copy the appropriate Windows or Mac installer onto your hard drive.
  2a. For Linux, we may or may not have a package for your distro.  After this point, we assume you know what to do. :)
3. Run the installer.
4. Double-click the BetterCodeVM.ova file, accept the defaults, and click Start.
